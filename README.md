# SpaceTraveling 

This project consists in a blog, using techlogies like:

- ReactJs
- NextJS
- Prismic CMS

## How it works? :zap:

First, you need to create a new post in Prismic CMS. After that, the post will be rendered in HomePage. By default, the HomePage rendered 2 posts per page (this is customizable).
In the PostPage, the info of the post and the content will be rendered. Some posts is already rendered in the cache, in this case the page will be loaded speedly.

The PostPage uses GetStaticProps, and the HomePage uses GetServerSideProps.

Check the code! üöÄ :heart_eyes:
